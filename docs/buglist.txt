1.
a) AngryBot.java
b) getNextMove
c) 71
d) Code was decrementing the energy level if the move was to stay in the same place when it should be decrementing if it was not going to stay
e) changed == to != on line 71 so that code would decrement for the right cause

2.
a) AngryBot.java
b)getNextMove()
c) 48
d) code was picking the wrong time to attack
e) changed (energyLevel < 2) to (energyLevel > 2) so that the bot would attack  if the energy level is above 2

3.
a) BullyBot.java
b)fireCannon()
c) 66-67
d) Was outputting an index out of bounds error and the wrong value for energy level
e)Changed the program so that j is incrementing instead of decrementing and energy level to decrement instead of increment

4.
a) ChickenBot.java
b) getNextMove()
c) 50
d) Code was trying to have the bot move even if the energy level was 0
e) changed code to only move when energy level was greater then 0 instead of greater then or equal to 0

5.
a) TimBot.java
b) harvestSpresso(int jolts)
c) 157
d) Code was not limiting the energy level at 99
e) Changed the if statement so it will put the energylevel back down to 99 if energylevel>99 instead of energylevel<99
